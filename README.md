## Assignment 1: Water Tank

### Description
A `WaterTank` has a capacity and an actual level. Capacity cannot be negative and the actual level can't exceed the capacity.
A `WaterTank` can be filled with liquid up to its capacity. If the volume exceeds the capacity, an overflow occurs.
A `WaterTank` can have a Tap attached. In this case it can be drained for a period of time for a maximum volume equals to the current level. Afterwards it will just spill no water.
A `Tap` defines the flow rate in units per minute.

### Assignment
Define proper unit tests covering both WaterTank and Tap class methods
